### VirtualAssistant with Python and APIs
I would like to demonstrate the program written in the Assistant.py file
Use the code for purposes if you wish to.
Download the project files using:<br>
github clone https://github.com/VIROOPAKSHC/VirtualAssistant

<i><b>Description:</b></i>
This virtual assistant program demonstrates the use of Python programming language and connects with several websites through API calls and gets the info on behalf of us. 
Working on this I hope to add many things to my virtual_Assistant so that it does more help to me. <br>
